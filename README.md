# SuperCraftBros Reloaded

##### Double0negative's SuperCraftBros plugin, reloaded!


## What is it?

Originally based off the classic Nintendo game, SuperCraftBros is a class-based PvP game where players fight to be the last one alive. This reloaded version offers a much more fleshed-out edition than Double0negative's original code and our version also comes with the promise of support for current Minecraft releases.


## Dependencies

* **Spigot**: 1.8.8+
* **WorldEdit**: 6.1.1+


## Get Help

For more information about this plugin and how to use it, please see our [wiki](https://github.com/jflory7/SuperCraftBros/wiki). If you need additional help, you can seek direct support in [#j on SpigotMC](https://irc.spi.gt/iris/?channels=j). I am not always idling in IRC, so if you need help, you may need to wait some time before you receive a response.
